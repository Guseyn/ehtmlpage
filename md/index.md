# EHTML — Extended HTML for Real Apps, Zero Build

## Build Dynamic Apps Using Mostly HTML
EHTML transforms standard HTML into a powerful application layer. Write less JavaScript and let HTML handle templating, data loading, rendering, and interactions.

---

## No-Build. No Bundlers. No Complexity.
EHTML runs directly in the browser using native ES modules and import maps. No Webpack, no Vite, no transpilers — just open your page and it works.

---

## Declarative Data Loading (Fetch JSON, HTML, SVG, Markdown)
Elements like `<e-json>`, `<e-html>`, `<e-markdown>`, and `<e-svg>` let you fetch and display content directly from HTML. Loading states, headers, caching, and mapping functions are all built-in.

---

## Powerful HTML-Native Templating
Use templates such as `e-for-each`, `e-if`, `e-reusable`, `e-wrapper`, and `e-page-with-url` to build loops, conditions, reusable components, and URL-aware pages — all without JavaScript glue.

---

## Advanced Form Handling (Nested JSON, Dynamic Values)
`<e-form>` and its companion elements (`e-form-object`, `e-form-array`, `e-form-dynamic-value`) serialize any form into deeply structured JSON. Add validation, progress indicators, uploads, and dynamic URLs with simple attributes.

---

## Real-Time WebSockets With No JS
With `<template is="e-ws">`, you can receive WebSocket messages as JSON and send messages with `<e-form>`, giving you real-time features like chat and live updates entirely in HTML.

---

## Built-In Actions for Interactive Behavior
Use high-level actions like `mapToTemplate`, `releaseTemplate`, `insertHTMLInto`, and more — all triggered from attributes, no custom scripts required.

---

## Local & Session Storage Made Easy
Elements like `e-local-storage-value` and `e-session-storage-value` let you integrate stored values directly into forms and attributes.

---

## Create Your Own Custom Elements
Extend EHTML by registering custom HTML elements or custom templates, enabling domain-specific UI patterns and reusable components that integrate seamlessly with the declarative EHTML ecosystem.

---

## Fast. Minimal. Maintainable.
EHTML keeps your frontend simple, readable, and fast — perfect for teams that want clarity, minimal dependencies, and an HTML-first architecture.

---

## Get Started in Minutes
Clone the repo, drop the `src` folder into your project, add an import map, and you're ready to build without compiling anything.
