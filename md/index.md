**EHTML (Extended HTML)** is a no-build, lightweight framework that turns standard HTML into a powerful application layer. Instead of relying on large JavaScript bundles or complex frontend tooling, EHTML uses custom elements and intuitive `data-*` attributes to let developers create dynamic interfaces directly in markup. A built-in MutationObserver keeps everything reactive, allowing pages to update automatically as content loads or changes.

With elements like `<e-html>` for modular page composition, `<e-json>` for fetching and mapping server data, and templates such as `e-for-each`, `e-if`, `e-reusable`, and `e-wrapper`, EHTML enables rich templating and reusable UI patterns using only HTML. Its advanced form system—including `<e-form>`, `<e-form-object>`, `<e-form-array>`, and `<e-form-dynamic-value>` — lets you build deeply nested JSON request bodies without writing custom JavaScript logic. Even WebSockets, Markdown, SVG, and URL-based pages can be handled declaratively through dedicated elements.

Beyond its custom tags, EHTML provides a powerful set of built-in actions like `mapToTemplate`, `releaseTemplate`, `insertHTMLInto` and others, giving developers high-level tools to manipulate the DOM, display loading states, or respond to AJAX events—all defined inline through attributes. Storage helpers such as `<e-local-storage-value>` and `<e-session-storage-value>` make global state trivial to integrate.

You can even extend EHTML with your own custom elements or custom templates by registering processing functions to integrate seamlessly into EHTML’s declarative workflow.

Together, these features create an ecosystem where HTML becomes expressive, maintainable, and capable of handling complex front-end logic. EHTML dramatically reduces JavaScript boilerplate, improves clarity, and enables teams to build interactive web applications faster—with a smaller footprint and clearer, more declarative structure.
