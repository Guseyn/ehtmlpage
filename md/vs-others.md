# EHTML vs CSR vs SSR


| Area / Feature                              | **EHTML (Extended HTML)**                                                                                                              | **CSR (Client-Side Rendering)**                                                                                                                             | **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**                                                                                                                                       |

| **Core Philosophy**                          | HTML-first. Enhanced with `<template>` and EHTML extensions. Browser remains the framework.                                                  | JavaScript-first. UI is fully constructed from JS components.                                                                                              | Server-first. HTML is generated on server using templating engines.                                                                                                   |
| **Templating Model**                         | Native `<template>` + EHTML features like `mapToTemplate` and `releaseTemplate`. No templating engine needed.                                | JSX, directives, component templates compiled into JS bundles.                                                                                              | Requires templating engines (EJS, Rails ERB, Blade, Razor, etc.).                                                                                                     |
| **Data Binding**                             | Declarative binding via `data-*` attributes. Data & view always decoupled. Structured mapping built-in.                                      | Components tightly coupled with their data sources. Harder to trace.                                                                                        | Data inserted during server render; templates don’t know where data came from.                                                                                        |
| **Nested Structures / Forms**                | Built-in nested form support with automatic JSON serialization.                                                                               | Requires custom form logic or libraries.                                                                                                                    | Server parses nested forms manually; limited dynamic interactions.                                                                                                    |
| **Dynamic Updates**                          | Uses HTML `<template>` and dynamic mapping utilities. Can update just the part you need.                                                      | Requires re-rendering component hierarchies, reconcilers, or signals.                                                                                       | Typically needs full page reload unless enhanced by TurboLinks/Turbo Frames.                                                                                          |
| **Routing Model**                            | Simple: HTML files + JSON endpoints. No client router required.                                                                               | Client-side routing libraries required.                                                                                                                     | Backend-driven routing; each route returns full HTML.                                                                                                                 |
| **Caching Strategy**                          | Strong. Data and templates are separated → headers/menus cached, content updated independently. Perfect for CDN/edge delivery.               | Weak. HTML is mostly empty, everything loads via JS, so CDN cannot cache rendered views.                                                                    | Limited. HTML and data tightly coupled → hard to cache partials; whole pages cached or nothing.                                                                        |
| **Performance Profile**                      | Very light. No framework JS. Fastest first paint. Only dynamic data loaded when needed.                                                       | Slow first load due to large JS bundles + hydration. High CPU overhead on client.                                                                           | Good first paint but waits for server to collect data. Entire page blocked until render finishes.                                                                     |
| **Build Step**                               | None. Pure browser execution with optional ES modules/import maps.                                                                            | Always requires bundlers/transpilers (Webpack, Vite, SWC).                                                                                                   | No front-end build step, but requires server template compilation.                                                                                                   |
| **Maintenance Complexity**                   | Extremely low. No framework churn. HTML remains stable for decades.                                                                           | High. Frequent framework updates, breaking changes, build-tool drift.                                                                                       | Medium. Template engines are stable, but backend coupling increases maintenance.                                                                                      |
| **Data Flow Transparency**                   | Fully transparent: HTML declares data sources; logic minimal; easy debugging.                                                                 | Hard to trace. Logic split between components, hooks, effects, stores.                                                                                      | Hard to trace: data lives in backend controllers/services, not visible in templates.                                                                                 |
| **Interactivity Level**                      | Excellent for most apps. Template mapping easily handles dynamic lists and partial updates.                                                   | Very high, especially for complex, real-time or granular UI interactions.                                                                                   | Limited without additional JS; mostly full reloads.                                                                                                                   |
| **WebSocket / Live Data**                    | Simple. EHTML patterns allow multi-template updates with minimal JS.                                                                          | Requires custom WebSocket clients + state management.                                                                                                       | Requires custom JS; server templates don’t help with real-time updates.                                                                                              |
| **SEO**                                      | Excellent. Full HTML loads first, dynamic content fills in later.                                                                             | Poor by default. HTML is mostly JS bootstrapping → requires SSR for good SEO.                                                                              | Excellent. Search engines receive full HTML immediately.                                                                                                              |
| **Progressive Enhancement**                  | Native. Without JS, most of the page still works.                                                                                             | Weak. CSR often fails entirely without JS.                                                                                                                  | Very strong. HTML-first.                                                                                                                                              |
| **Component Reuse**                          | Use `<template>` as components—simple, portable, no toolchain required.                                                                       | Components require framework syntax + build chain.                                                                                                          | Limited. Templates reusable server-side but not client-side.                                                                                                         |
| **Developer Experience**                     | Very high: simple HTML, declarative mapping, instant refresh, no virtual DOM.                                                                 | Heavy: component trees, dependency management, complex build pipelines.                                                                                    | Moderate: templating straightforward, but tied deeply to backend stack.                                                                                              |
| **First Load Experience**                    | Fastest: minimal JS, static HTML served immediately.                                                                                          | Slow: app waits for JS bundle download + execution.                                                                                                        | Can be slow: server waits for all data before sending HTML → blank screen until finished.                                                                           |
| **Resilience / Failure Modes**               | Very resilient: if dynamic data fails, static HTML still loads.                                                                                | Fragile: if JS fails, the whole page often breaks.                                                                                                          | Resilient: server returns HTML even if some data partials fail.                                                                                                      |
| **Technology Lock-In**                       | Low. EHTML sugar is HTML-based and easy to migrate or remove.                                                                                 | High. App structure locked into framework architecture.                                                                                                     | Medium. Migration depends on backend language and templating engine.                                                                                                |
| **Backend Dependency**                       | None. Backend just provides JSON + static HTML files.                                                                                         | Tight. Must integrate frontend build pipeline with backend.                                                                                                | Very tight. UI tied to backend language and templating engine.                                                                                                       |
| **Debugging Simplicity**                     | Extremely easy: inspect HTML + data attributes; no hidden lifecycle magic.                                                                    | Hard: data flows through multiple layers (hooks, effects, stores, frameworks).                                                                              | Moderate: server logs + template debugging required.                                                                                                                 |
                                                                                |
